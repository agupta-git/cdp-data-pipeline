covid19healthequitymetric,Metric,categorical,"Specifies metric: county_positivity_all_nopris,  county_positivity_low_hpi"
covid19healthequitymetric,Metric_Value,numeric,"Value associated with the metric specified in ""name"" column. county_positivity_all_nopris: calculated as the total number of positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 over a 7-day period (based on specimen collected date) divided by the total number of PCR tests conducted, excluding tests for persons out of state or with unknown county of residence and tests associated with prison, ICE, US Marshal, or Department of State Hospitals facilities.  This number is then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.  Each date represents the positivity of the previous 7 day period. county_positivity_low_hpi: Test positivity over a 7-day period (based on specimen collected date) for the tracts in HPI quartile 1 in a given county, excluding tests associated with prison, ICE, US Marshal, or Department of State Hospitals facilities. The California Healthy Places Index (HPI) is a composite measure of socioeconomic opportunity applied to census tracts that includes 25 individual indicators across economic, social, education, transportation, housing, environmental and neighborhood sectors. Race/ethnicity are not variables included in the calculation of the HPI. However, given historic and persistent systemic factors – such as housing discrimination, disparities in school funding, and paucity of employment opportunities – have led to disinvestment and high rates of poverty for communities of color, it should not be surprising that a disproportionate percentage of Latino and African-American Californians live in HPI quartile 1."
